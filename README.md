# Dominion Card Browser

A modern, interactive web application for browsing and filtering Dominion card game cards. Built with React and Vite, featuring multi-language support, advanced filtering, and a responsive design.

The application uses `dominion.json` as its data basis, containing all card and edition information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dominion
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in the terminal)

## Configuration

### Password Protection

Password protection can be enabled/disabled via environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
VITE_REQUIRE_PASSWORD=true
```

2. Set your password in `src/config/auth.js`:
```javascript
export const PASSWORD = 'your-password-here'
```

When `VITE_REQUIRE_PASSWORD` is set to `'true'`, users will be prompted for a password before accessing the application. The authentication state is stored in localStorage.

### Custom Card Images

You can upload your own card images to replace the default images. Uploaded images are stored in the browser's IndexedDB and persist across sessions.

1. Open the Settings overlay (click the ⚙️ button in the header)
2. Scroll to the "Image Upload" section
3. Click "Upload folder of images" and select a folder containing your card images
4. Images will be automatically matched to cards based on their filenames

**Filename Requirements:**
- Images must be named with the card's UUID (e.g., `d07e4264-98c8-4677-9492-b743f814eff9.jpg`)
- Alternatively, numeric IDs are supported (e.g., `123.jpg`)
- Supported image formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP

**How it works:**
- Uploaded images take priority over default images from the `/cards/` directory
- Images are stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB
- You can clear all uploaded images using the "Clear uploaded images" button
- The upload count shows how many images you have stored

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with hot module replacement

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - UI library
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **CSS3** - Styling with CSS custom properties

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory. The build is configured with a relative base path (`base: './'`), making it suitable for deployment to any subdirectory.

## Development

The application uses:
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback) for state management
- Context API for language management
- LocalStorage for persisting settings and authentication state
- IndexedDB for storing uploaded card images
- Responsive CSS with mobile-first design principles

## Data Format

Card and edition data is stored in `dominion.json`. The structure includes:
- Cards with properties: id, name (en/de), type, price, etc.
- Editions with properties: id, name (en/de), card_ids array
